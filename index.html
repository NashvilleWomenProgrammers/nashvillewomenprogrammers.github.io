        Who We Are
      </h2>
      <p>
        This group is hosted by women programmers with the goal to build a welcoming and beginner friendly environment to learn, in order to grow diversity in the programming field.
      </p>
      <p>
        We embrace the <a href="http://www.lambdajam.com/policies/">Lambda Jam Conference Diversity Policy</a> and welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race, ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level, neurotype, religion, elder status, family structure, culture, subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification.

        This group is hosted by women programmers with the goal to build a welcoming environment to learn and to grow diversity in the programming field.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have three main goals:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Connect women programmers and supporters so that we can have friends with whom to attend other programming events in town.
        </li>
        <li>
          Facilitate discovery and learning of new tech subjects from a speaker who has spent time studying, compiling, and translating information so a beginner to that topic can understand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Provide an encouraging space where people can gain speaking experience, and hopefully go on to speak at local user groups, conferences, etc… thus increasing minority visibility and inspiring other underrepresented people in tech.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Meetups are held on the second Monday each month. Come to code, learn, meet like-minded people, and have fun!

          <h3>Parking</h3>
          <p>
            There are many parking options near Cummins Station, ranging from free to pricey. We have listed the options starting with the cheapest options.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h4>Free Bike Parking</h4>
              <p>Free bike parking is available in front of Cummins Station. Don't forget your bike lock and reflectors for riding home at night!</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Less Than $1 or Free Street Parking</h4>
              <p>All of the parallel parking spaces along the front of Cummins Station (and the nearby streets) are <a href="http://www.parkitdowntown.com/parking/on-street-parking">free after 6pm</a>. A few of these spots are reserved for valet in the evenings, so if you see a valet sign, park elsewhere.</p>
              <p>If you arrive earlier than 6pm, put in just enough exact change to cover you until the spots turn free at 6PM.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Paid Lot Parking - Further, But Less Expensive</h4>
              <p>The Frist parking lot, across the street from Cummins Station, is the cheapest paid parking option.</p>
              <p>Rates: $1.50 first 1/2 hour; $6 first hour; $3 each additional hour; $24 daily max; Special events pricing as posted.</p>
              <p>Note: this parking lot is on the north side of Cummins Station, and Eventbrite is on the south side.  However, you can enter Cummins Station from the North and walk through the inside of the building to get to the Eventbrite office.</p>
              <p>More info on The First parking lot: <a href="http://www.parkitdowntown.com/nashville/frist-lot-ii">http://www.parkitdowntown.com/nashville/frist-lot-ii</a></p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Paid Lot Parking - Closer, But More Expensive</h4>
              <p>Two paid parking lots are available directly across from Cummins Station. Last time we inquired, the rates was $6/hour after 5PM, with a maximum evening cost of $12, unless there is a special event pricing in effect.</p>
              <p>If you eat in a restaurant in Cummins Station, you can get your parking validated, which reduces the cost to free in many cases.</p>
